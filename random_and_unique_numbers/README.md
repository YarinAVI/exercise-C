write a function that returns a matrix by rows and columns given to it.
the matrix returned by the function most contain unique random numbers.
the random numbers in the matrix will be in range of a lower bound(including) given, and higher bound(excluding) given to it.
if its impossible to create such matrix, the function should return NULL.

for example its impossible to create a 10 by 10 matrix with lower bound of randoms of 0 to 10, because there is only 9 numbers from 0 to 10 excluding and matrix size is 100(10x10) such that they are all unique
